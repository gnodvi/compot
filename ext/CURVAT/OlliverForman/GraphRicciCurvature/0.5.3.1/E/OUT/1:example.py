- Import an example NetworkX karate club graph

===== Compute the Ollivier-Ricci curvature of the given graph G =====


Karate Club Graph: The Ollivier-Ricci curvature of edge (0,1) is 0.279687

===== Compute the Forman-Ricci curvature of the given graph G =====
Karate Club Graph: The Forman-Ricci curvature of edge (0,1) is 101.724344



-Construct a directed graph example

===== Compute the Ollivier-Ricci curvature of the given directed graph Gd =====


Directed Graph: The Ollivier-Ricci curvature of edge(0,1) id -0.500000
Directed Graph: The Ollivier-Ricci curvature of edge(1,2) id 0.000000
Directed Graph: The Ollivier-Ricci curvature of edge(1,3) id 0.500000
Directed Graph: The Ollivier-Ricci curvature of edge(2,3) id 0.500000
Directed Graph: The Ollivier-Ricci curvature of edge(3,1) id 0.750000



===== Multiprocessing computation is also supported, default is 2 cpu.

=====  Compute Ricci flow metric - Optimal Transportation Distance =====

=====  Compute Ricci flow metric - Average Transportation Distance =====

=====  Compute Ricci flow metric - Sinkhorn distance for approximate optimal transportation distance =====

=====  You can also apply customized surgery function during Ricci flow process. =====
