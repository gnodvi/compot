# mmverify.py

This is a Metamath verifier written in Python, originally by Raph Levien.

Metamath is a formal language and an associated computer program (a proof checker) for archiving, verifying, and studying mathematical proofs.  The set of proved theorems using Metamath is [one of the largest bodies of formalized mathematics](http://us.metamath.org/mm_100.html). Multiple Metamath verifiers (written in different languages by different people) are used to verify them, reducing the risk that a software defect will lead to an incorrectly verified proof.

For a quick introduction to Metamath and its goals, see the video

For more information about Metamath, see the [Metamath website](http://us.metamath.org/).
