# 1) Dev Stack
- Get familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Get familiar with numpy
- Get familiar with github. You will be submitting your homeworks to your personal github

# 2) Strategy Pair Evaluation

- Given mixed strategies of two players and two utility matrices, compute value for each player.
- Do the same, but for zero-sum games. This time, your function should only take a single matrix (as the other one is implied)

# 3) Best Response Calculation

- Given a mixed strategy of a player and a utility matrix, compute opponent's best responding strategy

# 4) Best Response Value Calculation

- Given a mixed strategy of a player and a utility matrix, compute agent's value when facing best-responding opponent.

# 5) Finding Dominated Actions

- Given a matrix, find dominated actions of both row and column player

# 6) Iterated Removal of  Dominated Actions

- Given a matrix, run the "iterated removal of dominated actions" algorithm
