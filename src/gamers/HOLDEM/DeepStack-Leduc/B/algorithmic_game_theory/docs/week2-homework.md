# 1) Strategy Evaluation
- Compute $\Delta$
- Compute exploitabily and nash conv
- Compute $\epsilon$ (as in $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) 


# 2) Best Response Value Function
- Use your best response value function from week 1 
- Draw best-response value function for a matrix game with two actions for the row player 


# 3) Computing Nash by Enumerating Possible Supports
- Generate all possible supports
- Given a support, construct a set of equations that must hold under Nash equilibrium
- Try to solve the set of equations using https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html
