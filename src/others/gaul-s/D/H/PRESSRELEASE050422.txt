New release of open-source GAUL with support for Differential Evolution 
======================================================================= 
 
Reading, UK, April 22, 2005 -- The GAUL project is proud to announce 
the latest release of GAUL(TM) - the Genetic Algorithm Utility Library, 
a leading open-source programming library for evolutionary computation. 
GAUL 0.1849 contains enhancements to portability and scalability along 
with several new features. 
 
The most significant new feature is an efficient implementation of 
Price and Storn's Differential Evolution algorithm. Differential 
Evolution is a population-based, stochastic function optimiser using 
vector differences for perturbing the population. See 
http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html for further details. 
 
"GAUL's implementation of Differential Evolution offers a powerful 
method for optimising vectors. Differential Evolution often exhibits a 
compelling performance advantage over conventional genetic algorithms," 
says Stewart Adcock, Lead Developer of the GAUL project. "These new 
routines fit neatly within the pre-existing, simple and consistent API." 
 
GAUL is fully supported on UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, and all 
core features are available on Microsoft Windows environments. GAUL is 
able to utilise a wide range of computer platforms including 
Beowulf-style clusters and supercomputers with support for the MPI and 
OpenMP parallel programming standards, the forked-process model, and the 
pthreads programming interface. 
 
GAUL is already applied in many valuable domains, including protein 
structure prediction and rational drug discovery. With this release, 
GAUL solidifies its position as one of the premier frameworks for 
evolutionary computation being freely available to all research 
scientists and software developers. 
 
About GAUL: The Genetic Algorithm Utility Library is an OSI certified
