I'm dealing with serious overload between work and family commitments. If
you want to treat that as the authoritative repo for it, I have no
objections. Part of why I didn't respond earlier is that I was looking for
earlier versions so I might be able to reconstruct a better history, but I
didn't find much. mmverify.py became the basis for mm_xlat.py, which does
have more of a history, but that's probably out of scope for what you're
doing.

I own the copyright on mmverify.py so am also happy to relicense - I would
generally prefer permissive licenses such as MIT these days.
